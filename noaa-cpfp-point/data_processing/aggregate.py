def daily_aggregate(filepath):
    """
    Reads hourly data from a .txt file, aggregates it to daily, and returns a list of JSON objects that can be readily visualized in chart.

    Parameters:
        filepath (str): The path to the file containing the data to be aggregated.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries representing aggregated data, with each dictionary containing
              'date' and 'value' keys.

    Description:
        This function reads data from the specified file, aggregates it, and returns a list of JSON objects.
        The function performs the following steps:
        - Reads the content of the file.
        - Extracts the header lines from the file to determine the structure of the data.
        - Processes the data into a DataFrame.
        - Filters and aggregates the data.
        - Converts the aggregated data into a list of JSON objects, where each object contains 'date' and 'value' keys.

    Exceptions:
        - FileNotFoundError: If the specified file is not found.
        - Exception: If any other exception occurs during the processing, the exception message is returned.

    Note:
        - The input file is expected to have a .txt format with header lines indicating the structure of the data.
        - The function aggregates data from hourly to daily intervals.
        - The returned JSON list is suitable for use in frontend applications to visualize the aggregated data.

    Example:
        aggregated_data = daily_aggregate("/path/to/data_file.txt")
